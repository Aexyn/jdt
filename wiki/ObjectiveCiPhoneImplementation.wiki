#Details of the Objective C implementation of the JDT for the iPhone device
= Introduction =

The jdt application was re-implemented in the Objective C language as an iPhone application.
Most of the original jdt's application features were introduced to this version.

= Details =

*The major challenges for this task are:*
* The constraints of a mobile device (memory, user interface, hd...)
* The variation between Java and Objective C

==Content==
The following features of the original application were introduced to the iPhone version:
* Loading and saving tsin/smf files.
* Input methods - Point, 100 Random points
* View options - Lines, Triangles, Topo, Find, Info

==Implementation==
The is implemented as a tab bar application which has 3 tabs:
* Resources - A tab in which the user can store or load _tsin_ and _smf_ files.
* Settings - A tab which enables the user to choose between the Input methods and the View options + to clear the screen.
* Display - Display the current triangulation according to the settings.

===The Display Tab===
The display tab contains a user interface called _UIScrollView_ which is a container for the triangulation graphics.
The _UIScrollView_ enables scrolling + zooming in and out so that an image that is larger than the actual screen can be seen easily.
