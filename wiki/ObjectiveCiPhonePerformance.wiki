Performance and measurements of the iPhone objective C implementation<br>

= Introduction =

One of the tasks of this exercise is to compare the implementation's performance to the original implementation.<br>
For this we will perform run time measurements of the application features.<br>

= Details =
The measurements were done on the iPhone device itself and on an iPhone simulator on a Mac Book Air device.<br>
All measurements were done on the 1000 points files since the iPhone 2G could not handle bigger files.<br>
